Though I don't see the names of the 'old' terms (citrate (Re)-synthase activity & citrate (Si)-synthase activity) given as synonyms on the merged term. 

Also, I believe our current practice is to remove EC xrefs from the obsolete terms, right @pgaudet ?

Do those aspects need to be done manually ?",2025-03-12T15:32:53Z
